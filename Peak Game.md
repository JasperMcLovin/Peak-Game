Need: To improve hand eye coordination, reaction time, and fast input skills in people using a faced paced game that mixes a rhythm game and a platformer.

Problem Statement: Many people struggle with hand eye coordination, reaction time, and fast input skills, and my game will help improve those aspects. having to use multiple keys to manoeuvre around obstacles that are constantly moving and changing can help build skills and keep people entertained.

Skill Development: To develop the skills in Unity required to create the game, I would complete 2d platformer

Inputs: Movment keys (e.g WASD), jump key (space), dash key (shift). keybinds will likley be customisable

Processing: The program will check for collisions, or if the player has died, and will update the game accordingly, either updating player position or updating the game over screen. 

Outputs: The game will display the players position, or the game over screen

Transmission: The game will be single player with no need for online transmission

Storage: The game will store which levels the player has completed locally

User Interaction: Users will use keyboard inputs to control the character, being able to move around with WASD, jump with space, and dash with shift.

Core Gameplay: The player will be tasked with dodging attacks from enemys to the beat of a song, having to use the movement keys avalible to survive. If the player is hit to many times, they will die, and will have to restart from the beggining of the level.

Level Progression: The player will progress through levels, each one incresing in difficulty gardually as they go. There will also be boss levels, which will be a challenge for the player, combining the skills they have learnt throught the game into one difficult level.

Saving And Loading Data: The game will store what level the player has reached, so they dont have to restart the game every time they close it.

Performance Requirements:
